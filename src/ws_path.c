/**
 * @file ws_path.c  WebSocket path workaround and header injection
 *
 * libre's transp.c hardcodes the WebSocket request path as "/" with no public
 * API to change it.  We intercept websock_connect() and substitute the
 * configured path before the HTTP upgrade request is sent.
 *
 * Additionally, we inject the configured Origin header and any extra
 * WebSocket headers (ws_origin / ws_extra_headers from echosdk_config_t),
 * and override the keepalive interval (ws_keepalive_ms).
 *
 * Interposition mechanism (every platform, no linker flags): the libre build
 * is patched by cmake/patch-re-sources.cmake and compiled with
 * -DRE_WEBSOCK_CONNECT_OVERRIDE=1 -DRE_SIP_DIALOG_ROUTE_OVERRIDE=1, which
 * renames libre's definitions of websock_connect() and sip_dialog_route() to
 * __real_*.  This file owns the public names, so every call site — libre's
 * own included — resolves here at link time.  This replaced the GNU-ld
 * --wrap flags the .so links used to pass: Apple's linker has no --wrap, so
 * the WS routing fixes never reached iOS, and dist/ static archives demanded
 * that every consumer repeat the flags or fail to link.

 * would route one account's signalling to the other's server — worse than the

 * are ambiguous.
 *
 * It must switch back on, though, and it used to latch off for the rest of the
 * process.  That is how one stale account silently killed every later call: an
 * app that creates a fresh account per login attempt (the Flutter example did)
 * leaves the mistyped one behind, its server counts as a second server
 * forever, and with pinning gone the in-dialog ACK follows the dialog's
 * Record-Route instead of the WebSocket flow.  Behind a reverse proxy that
 * Record-Route is the server's own loopback address — Asterisk advertises
 * "127.0.0.1:8088" — so the ACK is dialled to a port on the *phone*, never
 * arrives, and the server tears the dialog down ~32 s later with media still
 * flowing.
 *
 * Refcount the servers instead of latching, and recompute on every account
 * create/destroy: pinning returns as soon as one server is left.
