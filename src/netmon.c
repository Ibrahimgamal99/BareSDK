/**
 * @file netmon.c  Network handover (Wi-Fi ↔ 4G/5G roaming)
 *
 * When the device moves between networks the local IP changes underneath a
 * live SIP stack.  Three things break at once and all three are repaired here:
 *
 *   1. The listening SIP transports are bound to an address that no longer
 *      exists, and any TCP/TLS/WSS connection over it is a dead socket that
 *      will not fail fast — it stalls until Timer B (32 s).
 *   2. The registrar's binding points at the old Contact, so inbound calls
 *      are routed into the void until the next REGISTER refresh (up to
 *      reg_expires seconds away).
 *   3. Active calls advertise the old address in the SDP `c=` line, so the
 *      peer keeps sending RTP to an address we can no longer receive on.
 *
 * The repair sequence, all on the re_main thread:
 *
 *      detect → settle → [transports] → [REGISTER] → [re-INVITE] → verify
 *
 * Detection is either pushed by the app (echosdk_network_changed(), driven
 * from ConnectivityManager / NWPathMonitor) or pulled by a poll timer.  Both
 * feed the same debounce: an interface coming up produces a burst of address
 * changes, and acting on the first one wastes a full REGISTER round-trip.
 * We wait until the address set has been stable for cfg.net_settle_ms.
 *
 * Media is verified rather than assumed.  A re-INVITE that gets a 200 OK can
 * still leave audio dead (the peer's ACK crosses a NAT that has not rebound,
 * SDP was answered with the wrong direction, the new path is blocked).  After
 * each re-INVITE we sample the stream's RX packet counter and check it has
 * advanced cfg.net_verify_ms later; if it has not, we re-offer, and after
 * cfg.net_max_attempts we report failure (and optionally hang up).
 *
 * RTP sockets themselves are never re-created: baresip binds them to the
 * wildcard address (stream_sock_alloc → rtp_listen with an unset sa), so they
 * follow the new default route automatically.  Only the address advertised in
 * the SDP has to change, which is exactly what call_reset_transp() does.
 *
 * That is the whole story for a direct-RTP call, and only half of it for an ICE
 * call.  ice.c writes the selected local candidate into the *media* address, and
 * a media-level `c=` line overrides the session-level one call_reset_transp()
 * rewrites (RFC 4566 §5.7); nothing re-gathers either, so the offer would carry
 * the address and the candidate list of the network the call just left.  Those
 * calls are migrated with an RFC 8445 §9 ICE restart instead —
 * bsdk_ice_restart(), whose re-INVITE carries new credentials, freshly gathered
 * candidates and the new address at both levels.  See ice_shim.c.
 *
 * A restart is only attempted when the local address actually moved.  A
 * WebSocket call whose path is unchanged is re-INVITEd for a different reason
 * (to re-bind the dialog to the new connection — see call_signals_over_ws), and
 * putting working media through an ICE restart for that would cost audio.
 *
 * ECHOSDK_NET_CALL_ICE_STALE is still emitted, but now only for an ICE call the
 * restart could not be performed for; cfg.net_ice_handover then decides how long
 * to keep trying, as before: BEST_EFFORT runs the normal verify/retry budget,
 * FAIL_FAST gives up after a single attempt so the app gets a prompt
 * CALL_MIGRATION_FAILED it can answer by re-placing the call, instead of the
 * user holding a silent handset for net_verify_ms × net_max_attempts.

/* ── Stall repair ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A handover is announced: an address appears or disappears and the repair
 * starts from a known cause.  A stall is the opposite — media stops with the
 * network looking exactly as it did a second ago.  Neither the peer's NAT
 * rebinding nor a multi-WAN router moving our flow to its other egress
 * address shows up as a local address change, and both leave the call up,
 * signalling healthy, with dead audio.  adapt.c already measures it; these
 * bounds decide what to do about it.
 *
 * The clock is tighter than a handover's.  By the time we are called the call
 * has already been silent for cfg.media_stall_ms (4 s by default), so a
 * 4 s verify on top would put the first verdict 8 s in — past the point where
 * the user has given up on the call.
 *
 * The budget is smaller for the same reason, and because the attempts are no
 * longer interchangeable: each one offers from a different local address
 * (next_laddr), so three attempts is the whole rotation on a phone plus one.
 *
 * The cooldown is what keeps a genuinely dead call from being re-INVITEd for
 * ever: stall detection re-arms once a repair leaves the SENT state, so
 * without it a call whose media never returns would enter a new repair every
 * media_stall_ms.  ROUNDS is the harder stop — after that many episodes the
 * problem is not one we can offer our way out of, and the MEDIA_STALL alert
 * is left to speak for itself. */
