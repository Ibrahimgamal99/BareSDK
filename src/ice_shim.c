/**
 * @file ice_shim.c  Deadline on ICE candidate gathering
 *
 * An outgoing call with a media-NAT does not send its INVITE when it is
 * placed.  baresip defers it (src/call.c, call_connect):
 *
 *     if (!call->acc->mnat)
 *             err = send_invite(call);
 *     else
 *             err = call_streams_alloc(call);   // INVITE deferred
 *
 * and sends it later from mnat_handler(), which runs when the media-NAT
 * reports that candidate gathering is done.  Nothing bounds how long that
 * takes, and there is one path where the report never comes at all: the ice
 * module's no-STUN/TURN case arms a 1 ms timer whose handler walks
 * `sess->medial` and calls the gather handler once per media entry, so an
 * empty list means the estab handler is never invoked.  The call then sits in
 * VOXSDK_CALL_CALLING forever — no INVITE on the wire, no event, nothing for
 * the app to react to.  `ua_connect()` returned 0, so the SDK cannot see it
 * either.
 *
 * Every other SIP client bounds this wait and offers whatever it has when the
 * clock runs out.  JsSIP and SIP.js resolve their offer promise on either
 * `icegatheringstatechange == complete` *or* a timer; dart-sip-ua does the
 * same with `ice_gathering_timeout`, default 500 ms; pjsua has
 * PJSUA_ICE_TRANSPORT_INIT_TIMEOUT (30 s) whose own comment calls it "a safety
 * net so the calling thread cannot block indefinitely if the callback never
 * arrives".  This file is that bound for VoxSDK, as cfg.ice_gathering_timeout_ms.
 *
 * ── How it hooks in ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `send_invite()` is static inside baresip, so there is no seam to call it
 * from.  The seam that does exist is the media-NAT vtable: baresip finds it
 * with mnat_find(baresip_mnatl(), "ice") and calls through the function
 * pointers.  We overwrite three of those pointers on the registered struct and
 * keep the originals, which is the same interposition ws_path.c performs on
 * libre with --wrap, applied to a vtable instead of the linker.
 *
 * Replacing the struct rather than registering a second media-NAT keeps its
 * identity intact: baresip matches `mnat->id` against "ice" to advertise
 * `Supported: ice` (src/ua.c), and `ftag` puts "+sip.ice" in the Contact.  A
 * differently-named clone would silently drop both.
 *
 * Wrapping sessh alone is not enough — baresip hands whatever `*sessp` we
 * return back to mediah() and updateh(), so those two have to unwrap it.  For
 * the same reason mediah() returns a wrapper of its own and attrh() unwraps it:
 * see the ICE-restart section below for why the media object has to be ours.
 *
 * ── ICE restart on network handover ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The second job of this file is the one thing netmon.c cannot do from where it
 * stands.  When the device moves between Wi-Fi and cellular, netmon migrates a
 * call with call_reset_transp(), which is sdp_session_set_laddr() plus a
 * re-INVITE.  That is the whole fix for a direct-RTP call, and no fix at all for
 * an ICE call:
 *
 *   - ice.c writes the selected local candidate into the *media* address
 *     (refresh_comp_laddr → sdp_media_set_laddr), and libre emits a
 *     media-level `c=` line whenever that is set (re/src/sdp/msg.c).  Per
 *     RFC 4566 §5.7 it overrides the session-level line netmon just rewrote,
 *     so the offer re-advertises the address that just went away.
 *   - Nothing re-gathers.  The ice module's update handler runs ice_start()
 *     with `started` already true, which only calls icem_update() and
 *     re-encodes the candidate list it already has, under the same
 *     ice-ufrag/ice-pwd.
 *
 * So the peer keeps sending RTP to the old address, and drops what arrives from
 * the new one — with ICE, a source that is not in the candidate list is not
 * accepted (Asterisk: "Source not in ICE active candidate list").  The call
 * stays up with dead audio until netmon runs out of attempts.
 *
 * The repair is an RFC 8445 §9 ICE restart, which needs a fresh
 * ice-ufrag/ice-pwd pair and a fresh gather — neither of which the ice module
 * exposes.  What it does expose, to us, is that we own its session object: the
 * inner `struct mnat_sess` is ours to throw away and allocate again.  A new one
 * mints new credentials (rand_str in session_alloc), writes them into the SDP,
 * and re-gathers against the interface that now carries the default route; when
 * it reports, baresip's mnat_handler turns it into the re-INVITE, which
 * therefore carries the new candidates *and* the new `c=` at both levels.
 *
 * Two things make that safe to do under a live call:
 *
 *   - the media object must survive the swap, because baresip stores it as
 *     `stream->mns` and hands it back to attrh().  Hence the wrapper: the
 *     pointer baresip holds is ours and does not move, while the ice module's
 *     media underneath it is replaced.
 *   - a gather that fails must not be reported as a failure.  baresip answers
 *     an mnat error with CALL_EVENT_CLOSED, which would hang up a call that is
 *     up and merely needs a new offer, so a failed restart releases the offer
 *     with whatever candidates exist instead.
 *
 * The RTP sockets are reused as they are — they are wildcard-bound and follow
 * the new default route on their own, and re-creating them would break the
 * media encryption that is keyed to them.

/* How long the candidate re-offer waits for a media-encryption handshake.
 *
 * The re-offer is a re-INVITE, and a re-INVITE mid-DTLS perturbs the handshake
 * it interrupts, so the offer waits for the handshake rather than racing it.
 *
 * It used to give up waiting after 300 ms and send anyway, on the reasoning
 * that a strict peer (Asterisk: "DTLS packet from <ip:port> dropped. Source
 * not in ICE active candidate list.") can never complete a handshake it is
 * dropping, so waiting on one is a deadlock and the offer is its only cure.
 * Both halves of that turned out to be wrong, measured across 22 calls
 * on-device (2026-08-31, inbound over WSS behind a NAT with two egress
 * addresses):
 *
 *   - The peer is not that strict.  It learns our address from the
 *     connectivity check itself (RFC 8445 s7.3.1.3, peer-reflexive), and the
 *     one call in the capture that reached `Secure` before this deadline
 *     expired went on to carry audio from an address that had never been
 *     signalled.  The re-offer was never the thing that made media flow.
 *
 *   - Sending it does not cure a strict peer either.  A re-offer under the
 *     same ice-ufrag/ice-pwd is not an ICE restart, so nothing on the peer
 *     re-runs its checks for the new candidate (RFC 8445 s9); what the peer
 *     did do was answer with `a=connection:new` and reset its own DTLS.  All
 *     9 calls that released the offer this way died — every subsequent
 *     handshake attempt drew no response at all — against 10 of 11 that never
 *     released one coming up with audio.
 *
 * So the deadline no longer releases the offer: it abandons it.  Holding
 * costs nothing (the poll releases the moment the handshake lands, which on a
 * healthy call is inside 50 ms), and the deadline exists only to stop polling
 * for a handshake that is not coming.  It spans dtls_srtp's own restart ladder
 * — 1200 ms plus four 2500 ms attempts, cmake/patches/dtls_srtp-state.new —
 * so a call that recovers late still gets its address across.
 *
 * A peer that genuinely filters on the signalled address needs an ICE restart
 * (fresh credentials, fresh gather — vox_ice_restart() already does exactly
 * that for handover), not a plain re-offer.  Nothing in the captures needs it:
 * every inbound call reached `Secure` or reached nothing, and the DTLS role
 * change (cmake/patches/dtls_srtp-setup.new) removes the address dependency
 * from the handshake in the first place. */

/* Not a trigger: `a=connection:new`.
 *
 * RFC 4145 §4 reads like one — the peer is asking for a new connection for the
 * stream — and Asterisk does send it when it tears down and re-creates its RTP
 * instance, sometimes without changing its ice-ufrag, which is a restart a
 * credential comparison cannot see.  Tried on-device on 2026-08-31 and reverted
 * the same hour: Asterisk attaches it to essentially every DTLS answer it
 * writes, including the answers to our own restarts.  Restarting on it produced
 * a storm — two restarts inside 70 ms, each provoking another answer carrying
 * it again — and the call it was meant to rescue still came up silent.
 *
 * A credential change stays the only signal used here, because it is the only
 * one that distinguishes "the peer threw our validated pair away" from "the
 * peer is answering an offer".
 *
 * Track the peer's ICE credentials and report a restart.
 *
 * A new ufrag from the peer is an RFC 8445 §9 ICE restart: it has discarded the
 * credentials under which our nominated pair was validated, along with the
 * permission that pair represented to accept media from our address.  Nothing
 * in baresip or libre notices.  ice.c's update handler runs `ice_start()` with
 * `sess->started` already true, which refreshes local addresses and returns
 * without calling icem_conncheck_start(), while libre's ufrag_decode() simply
 * overwrites `icem->rufrag` — so the new credentials land under a check list
 * that is already Completed, and no further check is ever sent.
 *
 * Observed on-device (2026-08-31): Asterisk answered a candidate re-offer with
 * `a=connection:new`, a fresh fingerprint and a fresh ice-ufrag, having
 * restarted both its DTLS association and its ICE session.  Our side restarted
 * neither.  It therefore had no validated pair covering our source address,
 * kept dropping our DTLS, and the call ran 36 s with tx 0 / rx 0 before the
 * peer gave up and sent BYE.
 *
 * Reading it back from the SDP rather than tracking it through ice_attrh()
 * keeps this independent of which attributes baresip chooses to route through

 * This is where a peer-reflexive candidate has to be re-offered.  ICE learns

 * and the peer accepts media from them.  A *peer-reflexive* candidate is
 * different: it is discovered from the connectivity checks themselves, after
 * the SDP has gone out, and RFC 8445 §5.1.3 does not signal it.  When ICE then
 * nominates that candidate — which is exactly what happens on a phone behind
 * NAT with no STUN server configured, where the host candidate is the only one
 * offered — we start sending media from an address the peer has never been
 * told about.
 *
 * A strict peer drops it.  Asterisk logs
 *
 *     res_rtp_asterisk.c: DTLS packet from <ip:port> dropped.
 *     Source not in ICE active candidate list.
 *
 * and since DTLS-SRTP gates RTP behind the handshake (`wait_secure`), the call
 * connects, signalling looks perfect, and neither side hears anything.  It hits
 * the answerer hardest: the answerer picks `a=setup:active` per RFC 5763 and so
 * is the side that sends first, into an address the peer will not accept.
 *
 * baresip already knows how to fix this — ice.c sets `send_reinvite` when the
 * selected local candidate changes — but only acts on it when its conncheck
 * handler is called with `update` set, which does not happen on this path
 * (`connectivity check is complete (update=0)`).  So do it here: if the address
 * ICE settled on is not the one we signalled, ask baresip to re-offer.  By the
 * time this runs, ice.c has already written the new candidates into the SDP,
 * so the re-INVITE carries them.
 *
 * Two things have since narrowed what this is for, and neither makes it free:
 * a peer learns our real address from the connectivity check itself, so it is
 * rarely waiting to be told; and a re-offer that goes out mid-handshake is the
 * single strongest predictor of a silent call in any capture we have.  So the
 * offer is held for the handshake and dropped if the handshake never lands
 * (VOX_ICE_REOFFER_SECURE_DEADLINE_MS), and the disagreement it answers is
 * itself now much rarer: the SDK no longer gathers on interfaces the media
 * does not use (cmake/patches/ice-ifsel.new), and an inbound call no longer
 * depends on the peer accepting a handshake we started
 * (cmake/patches/dtls_srtp-setup.new).
