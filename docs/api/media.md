# Media & audio

## Codecs

Set in `voxsdk_config_t`:

```c
cfg.audio_codecs[0]  = VOXSDK_CODEC_OPUS;
cfg.audio_codecs[1]  = VOXSDK_CODEC_PCMU;
cfg.audio_codec_count = 2;
```

| Codec | Enum | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Opus | `VOXSDK_CODEC_OPUS` | Wideband / fullband, preferred for WebRTC |
| G.711 µ-law | `VOXSDK_CODEC_PCMU` | 8 kHz, universal PSTN compatibility |
| G.711 A-law | `VOXSDK_CODEC_PCMA` | 8 kHz, European PSTN |

These three are the only codecs compiled into the library, on every platform.
Leaving `audio_codec_count` at 0 offers all three, Opus first — see
[Default codec list](#default-codec-list).

`VOXSDK_CODEC_G722` and `VOXSDK_CODEC_G726_32` still exist as enum
constants for ABI compatibility, but no module provides them; selecting one
has no effect beyond a warning.

### By name

Codecs can also be listed by name, which reaches any codec a loaded baresip
module registers. Names are matched case-insensitively; aliases: `opus`,
`ulaw`/`g711u`/`pcmu`, `alaw`/`g711a`/`pcma`. An unrecognized name is passed
through to baresip as-is.

```c
strcpy(cfg.audio_codec_names[0], "ulaw");
strcpy(cfg.audio_codec_names[1], "opus");
cfg.audio_codec_name_count = 2;
```

Both lists exist on `voxsdk_config_t` (global) and
`voxsdk_account_config_t` (per account). Precedence, highest first:

1. account `audio_codec_names`
2. account `audio_codecs`
3. global `audio_codec_names`
4. global `audio_codecs`

### Default codec list

When all four are empty — the default — the SDK offers a fixed list that is
identical on desktop and mobile:

```
opus/48000/2, PCMU/8000/1, PCMA/8000/1
```

This is pinned in `src/account.c` rather than left to baresip, which would
otherwise offer whatever codecs the linked modules happen to register. If a
build ever ships without Opus or G.711, the SDK logs `codec list "…" matched
no loaded codec` at account setup instead of silently offering something else.

In Flutter both levels are `List<String>` and use the name form:
`VoxSDKConfig(audioCodecs: ['ulaw', 'opus'])` globally,
`AccountConfig(audioCodecs: [...])` per account.

---

## Opus tuning

Fine-tune the Opus encoder at init time via `cfg.opus` (`voxsdk_opus_config_t`):

```c
cfg.opus.bitrate    = 32000;  // 0 = auto/VBR (default)
cfg.opus.complexity = 5;      // 0–10 CPU trade-off; -1 = opus default (9)
cfg.opus.cbr        = false;  // constant bitrate; false = VBR (default)
cfg.opus.dtx        = true;   // discontinuous transmission (silence suppression)
cfg.opus.fec        = true;   // in-band forward error correction
cfg.opus.stereo     = false;  // stereo output; false = mono (default)
```

All fields default to 0 / false / -1 (Opus encoder defaults). Only set what you need.

---

## Audio processing

Enable at init time via `voxsdk_config_t`:

```c
cfg.aec_mode              = VOXSDK_AEC_SUPPRESSOR;  // built-in half-duplex gate
cfg.aec_suppression_level = 1.0f;                    // 0.0–1.0; 1.0 = maximum
cfg.ns                    = true;   // noise suppression (Wiener gate)
cfg.agc                   = true;   // automatic gain control (normalise to −20 dBFS)
```

AEC mode options:

| Value | `aec_mode` int (Python) | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `VOXSDK_AEC_OFF` | `0` | No echo cancellation |
| `VOXSDK_AEC_SUPPRESSOR` | `1` | Built-in half-duplex gate (default) |
| `VOXSDK_AEC_WEBRTC` | `2` | WebRTC AEC (desktop only; requires `libwebrtc-audio-processing-1`) |

Toggle at runtime without re-dialling:

```c
voxsdk_set_aec_mode(VOXSDK_AEC_OFF);        // disable AEC
voxsdk_set_aec_mode(VOXSDK_AEC_SUPPRESSOR); // re-enable
voxsdk_set_aec_suppression_level(0.5f);      // softer suppression
voxsdk_set_ns(false);
voxsdk_set_agc(true);
```

**Python**

```python
import vox_sdk as sdk

# ── Configure before the first create_account() ──────────────────────────────
sdk.configure(
    aec_mode              = 1,    # 1 = suppressor (default); 2 = WebRTC full-duplex
    aec_suppression_level = 1.0,  # 0.0 = no suppression, 1.0 = maximum (default)
    ns                    = True, # noise suppression
    agc                   = True, # automatic gain control
)

# ── Toggle at runtime (any time, from any thread) ────────────────────────────
sdk.set_aec(True)                      # enable (uses mode set at configure())
sdk.set_aec(False)                     # disable

sdk.set_aec_mode(0)                    # 0 = off
sdk.set_aec_mode(1)                    # 1 = suppressor (restore default)
sdk.set_aec_mode(2)                    # 2 = WebRTC full-duplex (desktop only, opt-in build)

sdk.set_aec_suppression_level(0.6)     # tune aggressiveness (suppressor only)
                                        # 0.0 = TX passes through freely
                                        # 1.0 = maximum ducking (default)

sdk.set_ns(True)                       # noise suppression on/off
sdk.set_agc(True)                      # auto gain control on/off

sdk.set_mic_gain(6.0)                  # TX gain dB [-20, +20]; 0 = unity (bypass)
sdk.set_speaker_gain(-3.0)             # RX gain dB [-20, +20]; 0 = unity (bypass)
```

### AEC mode comparison

| | Suppressor (mode=1, default) | WebRTC (mode=2, opt-in) |
|--|--|--|
| Duplex | Half — ducks mic when far-end is loud | Full — both sides speak simultaneously |
| Double-talk | One side goes quiet | Both parties heard |
| CPU | Negligible | Moderate |
| Platform | Desktop | Desktop only |
| Build | None | `cmake -DVOXSDK_WITH_WEBRTC_AEC=ON` + `libwebrtc-audio-processing-1-dev` |

> **WebRTC AEC** must be selected at init time via `sdk.configure(aec_mode=2)`. Only `off ↔ init_mode` transitions are valid at runtime — switching between SUPPRESSOR and WEBRTC returns an error.
>
> **Mobile (Android / iOS):** full-duplex AEC is handled by the OS audio driver — Android captures through the `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` recording preset, iOS through `VoiceProcessingIO`. The echo is gone before the SDK sees a sample, so the software suppressor is **not** run there even when `aec_mode` is left at `SUPPRESSOR`: ducking the mic another 16.5 dB would only half-duplex a call the hardware had already made full-duplex. No SDK flag needed, and setting one changes nothing.

---

## App-owned audio device

By default the SDK opens the platform's capture and playback devices itself.
An app that would rather own them — because it already runs its own audio
engine, needs the mic for something else at the same time, or wants the OS
integration its platform team has already built — can take them over:

```c
voxsdk_audio_use_external(true);   /* SDK stops touching the hardware */
```

From then on the app supplies and consumes PCM. Nothing else about the call
changes; SIP, ICE, SRTP, codecs and the jitter buffer stay with the SDK.

```c
uint32_t srate, ptime;
uint8_t  ch;
voxsdk_audio_external_format(&srate, &ch, &ptime);   /* e.g. 8000, 1, 20 */

/* capture thread — this is what the far end hears */
voxsdk_audio_external_push(mic_pcm, nsamp);

/* playback thread — this is what the local user hears */
voxsdk_audio_external_pull(spk_pcm, nsamp);
```

PCM is S16LE interleaved. Any buffer size is accepted — the stack re-frames to
the call's ptime internally. `pull()` always fills the buffer completely,
writing silence when no call is up, so it can feed the speaker unconditionally.
Call both from the app's own audio threads, never from inside a VoxSDK event
callback.

`voxsdk_audio_use_external(false)` gives the devices back. Both directions
take effect immediately, including on a call already in progress.

Python:

```python
sdk.use_external_audio(True)

fmt = sdk.external_audio_format()        # (8000, 1, 20) or None before media
if fmt:
    srate, ch, ptime = fmt
    nsamp = srate * ch * ptime // 1000

    sdk.external_audio_push(mic_pcm)     # bytes / bytearray / array('h') / numpy
    spk_pcm = sdk.external_audio_pull(nsamp)   # always exactly nsamp samples
```

Dart:

```dart
sdk.useAppOwnedAudio(true);

final fmt = sdk.appOwnedAudioFormat;     // null until the call has media
if (fmt != null) {
  print('${fmt.sampleRate}Hz ${fmt.channels}ch, ${fmt.samplesPerFrame}/frame');
}
```

A complete working example is
[`bindings/python/examples/external_audio.py`](../../bindings/python/examples/external_audio.py):
it pushes a synthesised tone as the microphone and writes the far end to a WAV,
so the whole feature can be verified on a desktop with no audio hardware.

### Full API surface

C (`include/voxsdk.h`):

| | |
|---|---|
| `voxsdk_audio_use_external(bool)` | take/return the device; live, incl. mid-call |
| `voxsdk_audio_external_push(pcm, nsamp)` | captured mic audio → far end |
| `voxsdk_audio_external_pull(pcm, nsamp)` | far end → speaker; always fills |
| `voxsdk_audio_external_format(&srate, &ch, &ptime)` | negotiated format, `ENODEV` until media |
| `voxsdk_audio_external_is_active()` | is a call using the app-owned device |

Flutter (`VoxSDK`):

| | |
|---|---|
| `Future<void> useAppOwnedAudio(bool)` | throws `StateError` if the stack is down |
| `ExternalAudioFormat? appOwnedAudioFormat` | null until the call has media; `.samplesPerFrame` sizes your buffers |
| `bool appOwnedAudioActive` | false between calls even with the mode on |
| `Future<Map> appOwnedAudioStatus()` | native engine diagnostics — see below |
| `Stream<AppOwnedAudioError> appOwnedAudioErrors` | **handle this** — see below |
| `Future<void> notifyCallKitAudioActive(bool)` | iOS + CallKit only |

C++ (`SDK`): `use_external_audio`, `audio_push`, `audio_pull`,
`audio_format(AudioFormat&)`, `audio_external_active`. `audio_push`/`audio_pull`
deliberately do not throw — `ENODEV` is the normal state between calls and they
run on a realtime thread.

Python: `use_external_audio`, `external_audio_push` (any S16LE buffer),
`external_audio_pull`, `external_audio_format`, `external_audio_active`.

### Handle the error stream

Once the app owns the device the SDK is not holding it and **cannot see it
fail**. Nothing else reports these, and unhandled they present as a call that
connects with silence in one or both directions:

```dart
sdk.appOwnedAudioErrors.listen((e) => log('$e'));
```

| Code | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `mic-permission` | `RECORD_AUDIO` not granted — `AudioRecord` would not initialise |
| `unsupported-rate` | the device will not open the negotiated rate |
| `device-open` | the platform refused to build the capture/playback device |
| `capture-dead` / `playback-dead` | the stream died twice in a row and was given up on |
| `unavailable` | the native library did not load |

`appOwnedAudioStatus()` returns the native engine's own view, which is how you
tell "the device opened" from "audio is actually moving": `armed`, `paused`,
`running`, `available`, `sampleRate`, `channels`, `ptimeMs`, `pushFrames`,
`pullFrames`, `pushErrors`, `capturePeak`, `nonSilentFrames`, `lastError`.
A healthy 20 ms loop advances `pushFrames`/`pullFrames` by ~50 per second.

### Who calls push and pull

On mobile, **the realtime loop belongs in the native layer** — Kotlin over JNI,
Swift calling the C directly — not in Dart. A garbage-collection pause on the
capture path is a dropped frame, and there is no way to schedule around it. The
Dart API deliberately exposes only the mode switch and the format; there is no
`push`/`pull` on `VoxSDK` for that reason.

Whatever runs the loop must capture through the platform's voice path —
Android `MediaRecorder.AudioSource.VOICE_COMMUNICATION` with
`AudioManager.MODE_IN_COMMUNICATION`, iOS `VoiceProcessingIO` — see the echo
note below.

### Capture channel count (Android)

Opus commonly negotiates 48 kHz **stereo**, but no phone has a stereo
voice-communication capture path. Asking `AudioRecord` for `CHANNEL_IN_STEREO`
does not fail — it returns an initialised recorder that reads without error and
delivers audio far too quiet to hear, which is indistinguishable from a working
call by any frame-level check. Capture mono and up-mix to the negotiated channel
count before `push()`; the shipped engine does this.

### Quiet rooms read as digital silence

The `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` path runs the platform noise suppressor, which emits
*exact* digital silence rather than a noise floor when it decides there is no
speech. So `micLevelDbov` in the media stats legitimately reads `-127` (the
all-zero sentinel) for most frames of a quiet call, and the level is a 1 Hz
snapshot of a single frame. Neither is evidence of a broken capture path — count
frames that carried signal instead if you need to tell a gated microphone from a
dead one.

### Lifecycle

The device opens when the call gets media, not when it is answered, so
`voxsdk_audio_external_format()` returns `ENODEV` until then. There is **no
"media is up" event** to wait on: `CALL_ESTABLISHED` is a SIP state and races
the device by a few milliseconds, and a mid-call re-INVITE can renegotiate the
codec with no call-state change at all. Poll the format — it reports both that
the device opened and that its format changed — and stop the loops when the
call ends.

`voxsdk_audio_use_external()` is **not sticky across a restart**: `voxsdk_init()`
re-derives the device from the platform, so an app that shuts the stack down and
brings it back up has to ask again.

### One device, one call

baresip opens a device per call, but the app has one microphone and one speaker.
The most recently opened call owns them; a second concurrent call gets silence
rather than a share of the mic, which is the honest outcome — the app cannot
capture twice. Ending the newer call hands the devices back to the one still up.
Mixing two calls together is conferencing, and out of scope here.

> **Echo cancellation follows the device.** The SDK's AEC on mobile *is* the
> platform capture path — Android's `VOICE_COMMUNICATION` preset, iOS's
> `VoiceProcessingIO` — and those belong to the drivers this displaces. An app

## iOS audio session / CallKit

On iOS the SDK configures the shared `AVAudioSession` during `voxsdk_init()`:
category `PlayAndRecord`, mode `VoiceChat` (hardware AEC + earpiece routing),
options `AllowBluetooth | AllowBluetoothA2DP`. Whether it also *activates* that
session is a config decision:

| `platform_audio_activate` | Behavior | Use for |
|---|---|---|
| `true` (default) | Category + mode + `setActive:YES` at init | Apps that own audio outright, no CallKit |
| `false` | Category + mode only; activation left to the app | **CallKit apps** |

CallKit apps must set it to `false`. `CXProvider` owns the session, and Apple
requires activation to happen only in
`provider(_:didActivateAudioSession:)` — activating anywhere else takes the
exclusive `PlayAndRecord` route out from under CallKit. "Anywhere else" includes
starting the SDK at app launch, and a PushKit wake that starts the SDK while
CallKit is still reporting the incoming call. Nothing else changes: the category
is in place, so audio works the moment CallKit activates the session.

```c
cfg.platform_audio_activate = false;   /* CXProvider owns activation */
```

```dart
// Flutter: pair it with manageAudioSession: false so the plugin does not
// toggle activation around calls either.
final sdk = await VoxSDK.start(
  config: const VoxSDKConfig(platformAudioActivate: false),
  manageAudioSession: false,
);
```

Deactivation is symmetric — a CallKit app lets `didDeactivateAudioSession` do
it. Every non-iOS platform ignores this field.

Ordering follows from the same rule: the SDK opens its audio streams when the
call reaches ESTABLISHED, so answer the SIP call from
`provider(_:didActivateAudioSession:)` (or after it has fired) rather than
directly in `CXAnswerCallAction` — otherwise the streams open against a session
CallKit has not activated yet.

---

## Jitter buffer

Configure at init time:

```c
cfg.jitter_buffer_min_ms = 20;
cfg.jitter_buffer_max_ms = 150;
cfg.jbuf_type = VOXSDK_JBUF_ADAPTIVE;   // default
// cfg.jbuf_type = VOXSDK_JBUF_FIXED;   // constant depth at min_ms
```

Adjust at runtime (takes effect on new calls):

```c
voxsdk_set_jitter_buffer(20, 200);                    // resize adaptive buffer
voxsdk_set_jitter_buffer_type(VOXSDK_JBUF_FIXED);    // switch to fixed depth
voxsdk_set_jitter_buffer_type(VOXSDK_JBUF_ADAPTIVE); // back to adaptive
```

Both bounds default to baresip's built-in values when left at zero.

---

## Per-call DSCP / QoS

Override the RTP DSCP marking for a specific established call:

```c
// EF (46) — Expedited Forwarding, lowest latency
voxsdk_call_set_dscp_rtp(call, 46);
```

The global RTP and SIP DSCP values are set at init time via `cfg.dscp_rtp` and `cfg.dscp_sip`.

---

## Mute / unmute

```c
voxsdk_audio_mute(call, true);     // mute microphone (TX)
voxsdk_audio_mute(call, false);    // unmute microphone

voxsdk_audio_mute_rx(call, true);  // silence speaker (RX)
voxsdk_audio_mute_rx(call, false); // unmute speaker

// Query current TX mute state (no network round-trip)
bool muted = voxsdk_audio_is_muted(call);
```

`voxsdk_audio_mute` stops encoding and sending microphone audio.
`voxsdk_audio_mute_rx` disables the RTP receiver — the remote continues to send but audio is not decoded or played.

---

## Audio device enumeration

```c
voxsdk_audio_device_t devs[32];

int n = voxsdk_audio_list_input_devices(devs, 32);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("[%d] %s%s\n", i, devs[i].name,
           devs[i].is_default ? "  *default*" : "");

n = voxsdk_audio_list_output_devices(devs, 32);
for (int i = 0; i < n; i++)
    printf("[%d] %s%s\n", i, devs[i].name,
           devs[i].is_default ? "  *default*" : "");
```

`voxsdk_audio_device_t` fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `name` | `char[128]` | Device identifier — pass to `set_input/output_device` |
| `description` | `char[256]` | Human-readable label (may be empty) |
| `is_default` | `bool` | Platform default device |

Returns the number of entries written (≥ 0). Returns 0 if the audio module has not finished enumeration yet — call again after a short delay or after receiving the first `VOXSDK_EV_LOG` message.

---

## Audio device selection

```c
voxsdk_audio_set_input_device("Plantronics Headset");    // microphone
voxsdk_audio_set_output_device("Plantronics Headset");   // speaker
voxsdk_audio_set_input_device(NULL);                     // platform default
```

Device names come from `voxsdk_audio_list_input/output_devices()`. The change takes effect immediately on all active calls — no re-dial required.

---

## PCM media tap

Install a callback that receives every decoded audio frame:

```c
void my_tap(voxsdk_call_handle_t call,
            voxsdk_media_dir_t   dir,   // RX or TX
            const int16_t        *pcm,
            size_t                samples,
            uint32_t              sample_rate,
            uint8_t               channels,
            uint64_t              timestamp_us,
            void                 *userdata)
{
    // copy PCM data if needed; this runs on the audio thread
    memcpy(my_buf, pcm, samples * channels * sizeof(int16_t));
    my_buf_ready = true;
}

voxsdk_call_set_media_tap(call, my_tap, my_userdata);
voxsdk_call_set_media_tap(call, NULL, NULL);   // remove tap
```

**Rules:**
- Called from the **audio thread** — must return immediately.
- Copy PCM data to your own buffer; don't hold a reference to `pcm` past the callback.
- `dir == VOXSDK_MEDIA_DIR_RX` = decoded received audio (what you hear).
- `dir == VOXSDK_MEDIA_DIR_TX` = microphone audio before encoding (what you send).

---

## Audio recording

Record a call's audio to a single WAV file (PCM S16LE). Both the received (RX) and sent (TX) audio are clip-summed into one stream — you hear both sides of the conversation.

```c
voxsdk_call_record_start(call, "/tmp/call.wav");

// Stop and finalize the WAV header
voxsdk_call_record_stop(call);
```

**Output format:** PCM S16LE WAV. Sample rate and channel count are taken from the first audio frame (e.g. 48 kHz/2ch for Opus, 8 kHz/1ch for G.711).

**Typical usage — start on answer, stop on hangup:**

```c
case VOXSDK_EV_CALL_STATE:
    if (ev->u.call_state.state == VOXSDK_CALL_ESTABLISHED)
        voxsdk_call_record_start(ev->u.call_state.call, "/tmp/call.wav");
    if (ev->u.call_state.state == VOXSDK_CALL_ENDED)
        voxsdk_call_record_stop(ev->u.call_state.call);
```

**Notes:**
- Returns `EALREADY` if recording is already active.
- Always call `record_stop` before hangup to get a correctly finalized WAV header. If the call is destroyed first, the file is closed but sizes in the header will be wrong.
- Recording is independent of the PCM media tap — both can be active simultaneously.

## Media encryption

| Enum | Description |
|---|---|
| `VOXSDK_MEDIA_ENC_NONE` | No encryption (RTP) |
| `VOXSDK_MEDIA_ENC_SDES` | SRTP with SDP crypto attributes (RFC 4568) |
| `VOXSDK_MEDIA_ENC_DTLS_SRTP` | DTLS-SRTP (RFC 5764) — required for WebRTC |

Set globally in `voxsdk_config_t.media_enc` or per-account in `voxsdk_account_config_t.media_enc`.
