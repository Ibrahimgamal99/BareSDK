# Debugging SIP

## Init/shutdown trace

`voxsdk_init()` and `voxsdk_shutdown()` walk through ~14 stages. To trace which step a hang or crash occurs at, set the `VOXSDK_DEBUG_INIT` env var before launching:

```bash
# Linux / macOS
VOXSDK_DEBUG_INIT=1 ./your_app
```

```powershell
# Windows
$env:VOXSDK_DEBUG_INIT=1
.\your_app.exe
```

Output looks like:

```
[vox] step 1: deep_copy
[vox] step 2: log_init
[vox] step 3: libre_init
...
[vox] step 14: done
```

Leave the variable unset for normal (silent) operation.

## Log levels

Start with `log_level = 2` (info) for call flow visibility:

```c
cfg.log_level = 2;  // 0=err, 1=warn, 2=info, 3=debug
```

Use `log_level = 3` (debug) for maximum detail — internal state machines, timer events, packet parsing. Expect high output volume at this level.

---

## SIP trace

Enable per-message SIP tracing:

```c
cfg.trace_sip = true;
```

Each `VOXSDK_EV_SIP_TRACE` event contains the full SIP message. Log it:

```c
case VOXSDK_EV_SIP_TRACE: {
    const char *dir = (ev->u.sip_trace.dir == VOXSDK_MEDIA_DIR_TX)
                      ? "SEND" : "RECV";
    printf("[%s %s %s]\n%s\n",
           dir, ev->u.sip_trace.transport,
           ev->u.sip_trace.remote_addr,
           ev->u.sip_trace.raw_message);
    break;
}
```

### What to look for

| Check | Where |
|---|---|
| Registration sent? | Look for `REGISTER` in TX direction |
| Auth challenge? | Look for `401 Unauthorized` in RX; then `REGISTER` with `Authorization` header in TX |
| INVITE sent? | TX `INVITE` with correct `Contact` and SDP |
| SDP codecs match? | Compare `m=audio` line in INVITE and 200 OK |
| BYE received? | RX `BYE` — who terminated and why? |
| Error responses? | `4xx`, `5xx`, `6xx` — check `Reason` header |

---

## Pcap capture

Write packets to a file for Wireshark analysis:

```c
voxsdk_pcap_start("/tmp/debug.pcap");
// ... reproduce issue ...
voxsdk_pcap_stop();
```

Open in Wireshark:

```bash
wireshark /tmp/debug.pcap
```

### Useful Wireshark filters

| Filter | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `sip` | All SIP messages |
| `sip.Method == "REGISTER"` | Registration flow |
| `sip.Method == "INVITE"` | Call setup |
| `sip.Status-Code == 401` | Auth challenges |
| `rtp` | Media packets |
| `rtcp` | Quality reports |
| `sip || rtp || rtcp` | Full call flow |

### Wireshark tips

1. Right-click a SIP message → **Follow SIP Call** to see the complete dialog.
2. **Statistics → RTP → Stream Analysis** for jitter/loss graphs.
3. **Telephony → VoIP Calls** for a call ladder diagram.

## SDP negotiation

Enable SDP diff to see codec and encryption negotiation:

```c
cfg.trace_sdp_diff = true;
```

The `VOXSDK_EV_SDP_NEGOTIATION` event shows:

```c
case VOXSDK_EV_SDP_NEGOTIATION: {
    printf("Codec: %s  Crypto: %s\n",
           ev->u.sdp.negotiated_codec,
           ev->u.sdp.negotiated_crypto);
    // Check rejected_codecs and warnings arrays
    break;
}
```

Common issues:
- **No matching codec** → `negotiated_codec` is NULL; check `audio_codecs` config.
- **Crypto mismatch** → `negotiated_crypto` is "NONE" when you expected "DTLS-SRTP"; check `media_enc` setting.

---

## Media stats

Periodic stats reveal audio quality problems:

```c
cfg.stats_interval_ms = 3000;
```

```c
case VOXSDK_EV_MEDIA_STATS: {
    printf("MOS-LQ=%.2f loss=%.1f%% jitter=%.1fms RTT=%.1fms\n",
           ev->u.stats.mos_lq, ev->u.stats.loss_pct,
           ev->u.stats.jitter_ms, ev->u.stats.rtt_ms);
    break;
}
```

### Interpreting stats

| Metric | Good | Warning | Bad |
|---|---|---|---|
| MOS-LQ | ≥ 4.0 | 3.6–4.0 | < 3.6 |
| Loss | < 1% | 1–3% | > 3% |
| Jitter | < 20 ms | 20–50 ms | > 50 ms |
| RTT | < 100 ms | 100–200 ms | > 200 ms |

## Registration debugging

| Problem | Check |
|---|---|
| No REGISTER sent | `voxsdk_account_register()` called? Network reachable? |
| 401 Unauthorized | Wrong `uri` or `password`; check `auth_user` override |
| 403 Forbidden | Account not provisioned on server; check `uri` domain |
| 408 Timeout | Wrong `server_host`/`server_port`; firewall blocks SIP port |
| Registration drops | `reg_expires` too short; keepalive not working; NAT timeout |

### Retry policy

The SDK retries automatically with exponential backoff:

```
attempt 1: wait 2s    (reg_retry_initial_ms)
attempt 2: wait 4s    (× backoff = 2.0)
attempt 3: wait 8s
attempt 4: wait 16s
...
max:      wait 5 min  (reg_retry_max_ms)
```

Monitor retries via `retry_attempt` and `retry_delay_ms` in `VOXSDK_EV_REG_STATE`.

## Common error codes

| Code | Meaning | Action |
|---|---|---|
| `VOXSDK_ERR_DNS` | Cannot resolve server hostname | Check DNS / network |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_TRANSPORT` | TCP/TLS/WebSocket connection failed | Check firewall, TLS cert |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_AUTH` | SIP authentication failed | Verify credentials |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_TIMEOUT` | No response (timer B/F expired) | Check server reachability |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_SERVER_5XX` | Server error | Check server logs |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_WS_PROTOCOL_REJECTED` | WebSocket upgrade rejected | Check `ws_origin`, server config |
| `VOXSDK_ERR_STATE` | API called in wrong lifecycle state | Check call/account state before calling |

## Silent failures worth knowing about

A SIP stack has several places where a request is accepted and then never
arrives, and where the value that would tell you so is indistinguishable from a
legitimate one. These are the log lines the SDK emits so that does not happen.

### The BYE that never left

```
VoxSDK/sipsess: BYE queued
VoxSDK/sipsess: BYE could not be sent (…) — the peer will stay on the call
                 until it gives up on its own
```

libre discards the return value of `sipsess_bye()`, and there are three
separate ways a BYE can be skipped, so a hangup can report success while the
far end stays connected. Read the line at teardown:

| Line at hangup | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `BYE queued` | The request was accepted. If nothing reaches the wire, the failure is in routing or transport. |
| `BYE could not be sent (…)` | The session layer refused; the error names why. |
| neither | The session destructor never got that far — a transaction is still pending. |

### In-dialog requests routed away from the WebSocket flow

```
VoxSDK: ws in-dialog route echo:5060 is not the registration flow;
         routing over pbx.example.com:443 instead (RFC 7118 B.2)
```

A UAS dialog's route set is only the peer's Record-Route; unlike a UAC's, it
does not begin with your outbound proxy. A PBX behind a reverse proxy commonly
Record-Routes its own internal address — or omits Record-Route entirely, leaving
libre to route to a Contact like `sip:asterisk@echo:5060`, a hostname that
resolves nowhere. The lookup then fails *asynchronously*, long after the request
was accepted. This line means the SDK put it back on the registration flow.

### ICE candidates the peer was never told about

```
VoxSDK/ice: selected local candidate <addr> was never signalled (offered <addr>)
             — re-offering so the peer accepts our media
```

See [NAT traversal](nat_traversal.md#when-the-peer-drops-your-media). Note that
this re-offer keeps the session credentials, so it only helps with peers that
re-read candidates without an ICE restart. The restart the SDK does perform is
the one on network handover, logged as `restarting ICE on <addr>`.

### ICE gathering that never finishes

```
VoxSDK/ice: candidate gathering did not complete in time; offering the
             candidates gathered so far (cfg.ice_gathering_timeout_ms=2000)
```

With a media-NAT configured the INVITE is deferred until gathering reports
complete. `cfg.ice_gathering_timeout_ms` bounds that wait; without it an
outgoing call can sit in `CALLING` with no SIP message on the wire at all.

The word before "gathering" says which wait it was: `candidate` for the one on
dial, `restart` for the re-gather of an ICE restart on network handover.

### ICE restart on handover

```
VoxSDK/ice: restarting ICE on 100.82.7.19 — new credentials, re-gathering,
             re-INVITE follows within 2000 ms
```

How an ICE call is migrated: the whole ICE session is replaced so the re-INVITE
carries candidates for the network the device is on now. See
[network handover](network_handover.md#ice-calls). The re-INVITE itself appears
after this line, when the re-gather reports or the deadline expires — so a
`CALL_MIGRATING` event without a re-INVITE on the wire for up to
`ice_gathering_timeout_ms` is expected here, not a stall.

If a call still fails to migrate, look for the reasons a restart could not be
performed:

```
VoxSDK/ice: restart: replacement session failed (...) — keeping the current ICE state
VoxSDK/ice: restart gathering failed (...) — offering the candidates gathered so far
```

The first falls back to the plain re-INVITE and emits `CALL_ICE_STALE`; the
second still offers, deliberately, because reporting a media-NAT failure to
baresip would close a call that is up and merely needs a new offer.

### Audio levels: `NaN` is not silence

`mic_level_dbov` and `audio_level_dbov` start as `NaN` and become a real dBov
figure only once a frame has been measured. `-127.0` is a *measurement* — it
means the samples were all zero.

| Reading | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `NaN` | No frame was measured. Media never started, or the tap is not in the chain. |
| `-127.0` | Frames were measured and are digital silence — a dead capture path, not a quiet room. |
| anything else | Real audio. |

Reading them together is what separates "no media at all" from "media flowing
one way": `mic NaN / spk NaN` with zero RTP counters is a dead call, while
`mic -127.0 / spk -35.0` with healthy counters is a capture problem.

### "No common audio or video codecs" that is not about codecs

baresip disables a stream whose media profile it cannot match and then reports
the call as having no common codecs. An account offering `RTP/AVP` against a
peer offering `UDP/TLS/RTP/SAVPF` fails with a full, perfectly compatible codec
list on both sides. When the account offers no encryption the SDK says so
instead:

> No common media: this account offers unencrypted RTP and the peer requires
> encrypted media (set media_enc, e.g. DTLS-SRTP)

A WSS/WebRTC-facing PBX always offers `SAVPF`; set `media_enc` to DTLS-SRTP.

## Debug workflow

1. Set `log_level = 2`, `trace_sip = true`, `trace_sdp_diff = true`.
2. Start pcap capture: `voxsdk_pcap_start("debug.pcap")`.
3. Reproduce the issue.
4. Stop pcap: `voxsdk_pcap_stop()`.
5. Review SIP trace output for message flow.
6. Open pcap in Wireshark for detailed analysis.
7. Set `log_level = 3` if more detail is needed.
