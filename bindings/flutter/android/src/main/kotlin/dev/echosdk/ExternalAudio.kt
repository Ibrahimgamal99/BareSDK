/**
 * Direct access to EchoSDK's app-owned audio device.
 *
 * These are the only SDK calls made from a realtime audio thread, which is why
 * they bypass Dart entirely: the loop has one frame-time (10-20 ms) to capture,
 * hand over, take the far end's audio back and write it out, and a Dart isolate
 * hop plus a GC pause does not fit in that budget.
 *
 * The entry points live in libechosdk.so itself (platform/android/
 * audio_external_jni.c), so nothing here needs an NDK build. Deliberately in
 * `dev.echosdk` rather than `dev.echosdk.flutter`: it is a plain Android
 * binding and any Android consumer can use it, Flutter or not.
 *
 * PCM is S16LE interleaved at the rate [format] reports. Buffers must be
 * **direct** ByteBuffers — a heap buffer has no stable address to hand C, and
 * is rejected with [EINVAL].
