# VoxSDK Flutter plugin — iOS.

# Vendors the prebuilt dynamic VoxSDK.xcframework (built on macOS/CI by
# scripts/build-ios.sh, which stages it here itself) and compiles the small Swift shim (audio session / speaker routing /
# NWPathMonitor network callbacks).

  # static library (Flutter's default — no use_frameworks!), so a static lib
  # never links anything itself and the flag does not reach the app target's
  # link line on its own. Everything the Dart side touches is resolved with
  # dlsym at runtime and so never noticed, but VoxSDKExternalAudio.m calls
  # voxsdk_audio_external_push/_pull/_format directly from the VPIO render
  # callback — those are the only link-time references in the app, and without
  # this they fail as "Undefined symbol: _voxsdk_audio_external_push".
