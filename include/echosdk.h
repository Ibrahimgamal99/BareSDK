/**
 * Tell the SDK that the underlying network may have changed.
 *
 * Call this from the platform's connectivity callback:
 *   Android — ConnectivityManager.NetworkCallback onAvailable / onLost /
 *             onCapabilitiesChanged
 *   iOS     — NWPathMonitor pathUpdateHandler
 *   Desktop — NetworkManager / SCNetworkReachability / NotifyAddrChange, or
 *             leave it to the built-in poller (cfg.net_monitor_interval_s).
 *
 * Safe to call from any thread and as often as the OS fires.  Calls are
 * coalesced: the handover runs once the address set has been stable for
 * cfg.net_settle_ms.  Returns immediately — progress is reported through
 * ECHOSDK_EV_NETWORK events.
 *
 * The handover performs, in order:
 *   1. re-scan local addresses and refresh the DNS resolver list
 *   2. flush and re-bind all SIP transports (drops dead TCP/TLS/WS sockets)
 *   3. re-REGISTER every account the app asked to be registered
 *   4. re-INVITE every active call with the new local address in the SDP
 *   5. verify RTP resumes on the new path, retrying the re-INVITE if not
 *
 * @return ECHOSDK_OK, or ECHOSDK_ERR_STATE if the SDK is not initialized.
