# iOS only. Android has no CI job any more (see .github/workflows/
# build-mobile.yml) — build its jniLibs locally with scripts/build-android.sh.
#
# Why this exists: the plugin ships *prebuilt* binaries, so a consumer adding
# it as a git dependency gets whatever is committed — not whatever CI last
# built. CI uploads the xcframework as an artifact, but nothing commits it
# back, so the two drift silently. That drift has already shipped once: the
# committed libechosdk.so predated the baresdk_* -> echosdk_* rename and
# exported none of the symbols ffi_bindings.dart looks up, so apps built,
# installed, and then failed at the first SDK call.
#
# Nothing here is committed for you — review, then `git add` the path printed
# at the end.
#
# Requires: gh (authenticated). Symbol verification additionally wants nm; it
# falls back to probing the string table where unavailable.
