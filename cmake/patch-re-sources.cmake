# patch-re-sources.cmake
# Apply EchoSDK's libre patches at build time.
# Usage: cmake -DSOURCE_DIR=path/to/re -P patch-re-sources.cmake
#
# third_party/re is fetched by scripts/fetch-third-party.sh at a pinned
# revision and is gitignored — not a submodule — so an in-place patch cannot
# leak into upstream history (the hazard fix-msvc-re.cmake retired over).
# Each patch is idempotent behind a "EchoSDK-patched" marker and fails loudly
# when a libre bump moves the text it splices at, in the spirit of the
# configure-time prototype guard in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# Why patches instead of GNU ld's --wrap (which used to carry two of these
# fixes on Linux/Android): Apple's linker has no --wrap, so iOS builds
# silently shipped without them.  The rename patches below are the
# compile-time equivalent — libre's definition moves to __real_*, EchoSDK's
# src/ws_path.c owns the public name, and every call site resolves to it at
# link time on every platform.  No linker flags, and dist/ archives no longer
# require consumers to pass any.

# 1. sipsess/reply.c — hanging up an answered incoming call must send the BYE
#
# A UAS that rang before answering holds two reply records with the same
# INVITE CSeq (the 1xx's and the 2xx's), and cmp_handler matches on the CSeq
# alone.  list_apply() stops at the first hit, so the ACK freed exactly one;
# the survivor made the session destructor's termwait() defer the BYE to the
# record's 64*T1 (32 s) retransmit timeout.  Hanging up an answered incoming
# call reported success with nothing on the wire, and the caller's eventual
# BYE was answered 481.  Drain every record the ACK matches — that is the
# intended semantic anyway: these records exist to retransmit the response
# until the ACK arrives.  A plain bug fix, upstreamable as-is.

# 2. sip/dialog.c — route accessor rename behind RE_SIP_DIALOG_ROUTE_OVERRIDE
#
# Every in-dialog request (BYE, re-INVITE, ACK, INFO, PRACK, UPDATE) fetches
# its destination through sip_dialog_route().  When the PBX sends no
# Record-Route, libre falls back to the peer's Contact — behind a reverse
# proxy that names the server's own internal address, so the request dies in
# DNS after being reported sent (RFC 7118 B.2 says a WebSocket client's
# requests belong on the flow the registration established).  EchoSDK decides
# the route in bsdk_ws_route_override() (src/ws_path.c); this rename lets it
# own the public accessor.
