# patch-re-sources.cmake
# Apply VoxSDK's libre patches at build time.
# Usage: cmake -DSOURCE_DIR=path/to/re -P patch-re-sources.cmake
#
# third_party/re is fetched by scripts/fetch-third-party.sh at a pinned
# revision and is gitignored — not a submodule — so an in-place patch cannot
# leak into upstream history (the hazard fix-msvc-re.cmake retired over).
# Each patch is idempotent behind a "VoxSDK-patched" marker and fails loudly
# when a libre bump moves the text it splices at, in the spirit of the
# configure-time prototype guard in CMakeLists.txt.
#
# Why patches instead of GNU ld's --wrap (which used to carry two of these
# fixes on Linux/Android): Apple's linker has no --wrap, so iOS builds
# silently shipped without them.  The rename patches below are the
# compile-time equivalent — libre's definition moves to __real_*, VoxSDK's
# src/ws_path.c owns the public name, and every call site resolves to it at
# link time on every platform.  No linker flags, and dist/ archives no longer
# require consumers to pass any.

# call reported success with nothing on the wire, and the caller's eventual

# 2. sip/dialog.c — route accessor rename behind RE_SIP_DIALOG_ROUTE_OVERRIDE
#
# Every in-dialog request (BYE, re-INVITE, ACK, INFO, PRACK, UPDATE) fetches
# its destination through sip_dialog_route().  When the PBX sends no
# Record-Route, libre falls back to the peer's Contact — behind a reverse
# proxy that names the server's own internal address, so the request dies in
# DNS after being reported sent (RFC 7118 B.2 says a WebSocket client's
# requests belong on the flow the registration established).  VoxSDK decides
# the route in vox_ws_route_override() (src/ws_path.c); this rename lets it
# own the public accessor.

#
# The registrar keys an AOR binding on the Contact URI.  With the local IP in
# it, a device that moves between Wi-Fi and cellular registers a *new* binding
# instead of replacing its own, and the abandoned one — a WebSocket that no
# longer exists — stays in the AOR until it expires.  Inbound calls are then
# delivered to a dead contact on the way to the live one.  Measured on-device
# (2026-08-31): "[2 bindings]" for the whole session, and 6.2 s from INVITE to
# alerting on that extension against 0.33 s on a single-binding one.
#
# The fix is the host RFC 7118 prescribes: a stable per-instance name in the
# ".invalid" domain, taken from the instance-id baresip already advertises in
# the contact params.  The full rationale is in the hunk.
