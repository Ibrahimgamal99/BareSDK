# patch-baresip-sources.cmake
# Apply EchoSDK's baresip patches at build time.  Two jobs:
#   1. Disable baresip's executables (baresip_exe, test/, webrtc/) everywhere.
#   2. Make dtls_srtp recover from a handshake that is perturbed or stalls.
# Usage: cmake -DSOURCE_DIR=path/to/baresip -P patch-baresip-sources.cmake
#
# third_party/baresip is fetched by scripts/fetch-third-party.sh at a pinned
# revision and is gitignored, so an in-place patch cannot leak into upstream
# history.  Each job is idempotent behind its own marker and fails loudly when
# a baresip bump moves the text it splices at, rather than silently building
# without the fix.
#
# The SDK owns the public websock_connect() and sip_dialog_route() names:
# libre's definitions are renamed to __real_* (cmake/patch-re-sources.cmake)
# and the only provider of the public symbols is EchoSDK's src/ws_path.c.
# baresip's executables link libre directly without ws_path.c, so they stop
# linking — and the SDK only ever consumes libbaresip.a anyway.  This is the
# executable-disabling half of what fix-msvc-baresip.cmake did for MSVC,
# promoted to every platform now that the rename is unconditional.
#
# Idempotent behind the "# EchoSDK-disabled" marker (the legacy
# "# EchoSDK-msvc-disabled" marker from fix-msvc-baresip.cmake also counts, so
# a Windows tree patched by the older script is left alone).

# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Job 2: dtls_srtp — a handshake that is perturbed or stalls must recover
#
# media_start() latches `started` and nothing ever clears it, so the module
# starts a DTLS association exactly once per stream for the life of a call.
# Two consequences, both reached on-device (2026-08-26, inbound call over WSS
# behind a NAT presenting more than one egress IP):
#
#   - A re-negotiation that reverses the DTLS role is decoded into `st->active`
#     and then discarded, because media_start() returns early.  Each side ends
#     up waiting for the other to be the client.
#   - A handshake that simply never completes — a ClientHello lost while the
#     remote address moved under it, a peer that restarted its own association
#     across a re-INVITE — is never retried.
#
# Either way `menc_secure` is never set, stream_is_ready() stays false,
# audio_update() is never called, and the call sits fully established with
# tx 0 / rx 0 and no audio in either direction while signalling looks perfect.
#
# src/ice_shim.c stops the SDK from causing the first case itself (it holds its
# candidate re-offer until the handshake finishes).  These patches make the
# module survive the case when something else causes it.
#
# The hunks live as verbatim .old/.new file pairs in cmake/patches/ rather than
# as inline strings: the replacement is ~90 lines of C, and CMake escaping of
# tabs, semicolons and quotes at that size is its own source of bugs.
